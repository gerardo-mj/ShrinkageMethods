# ShrinkageMethods
This repository contains the code and resources used for the study on the effectiveness of linear shrinkage methods in portfolio optimization. The primary objective was to compare the performance of the traditional Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM) with various shrinkage methods, including Constant Correlation Model (CCM), Identity Matrix (IM), Constant Variance Matrix (CVM), Single Factor Matrix (SFM), and Oracle Approximating Shrinkage (OAS).

The analysis was conducted using historical stock data from the IBEX 35 and S&P 500 markets, covering the period from 2013 to 2023. A back-testing framework was implemented to evaluate the performance of these methods, focusing on metrics such as annual returns, volatility, and the Sharpe ratio.
